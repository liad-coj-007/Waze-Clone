# Waze-Like Routing Simulator

A full-stack simulation of a navigation system inspired by Waze.  
Backend implemented in **C++** for graph processing and shortest path calculation.  
Frontend implemented in **JavaScript** to visualize routes and traffic on an interactive map.

## Features

- **Graph-Based City Map**
  - Nodes represent intersections or key locations.
  - Edges represent roads with weights (distance or travel time).
  - Adjacency list for efficient storage and computation.

- **Shortest Path Algorithms**
  - Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for shortest path calculation.
  - Supports multiple routes and alternative paths.

- **Dynamic Weight Updates**
  - Simulate traffic conditions by updating edge weights.
  - Allows testing of adaptive routing.

- **Interactive Frontend**
  - Visualize the city map using HTML5 Canvas or map libraries.
  - Highlight routes dynamically as calculated by the backend.
  - Color-coded routes for multiple paths or CPUs.

- **Scalable Architecture**
  - Backend in C++ for performance.
  - Frontend in JS for interactivity and visualization.
  - Easy integration via JSON API between C++ backend and JS frontend.
